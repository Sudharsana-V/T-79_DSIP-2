SpeakTherapy is an end-to-end, multilingual speech therapy system built for India that works even in low-bandwidth rural settings. Instead of uploading raw audio, it processes speech on-device into compact features (like MFCC/phoneme representations), protects privacy, and enables phoneme-level error detection (substitutions/omissions/distortions). Our AI then turns those errors into therapist-ready insights, auto-generates personalized therapy plans, and produces SOAP notes in seconds to cut manual workload and improve consistency. Finally, we extend therapy beyond the clinic through caregiver/parent engagement and progress tracking—closing the loop from assessment → intervention → follow-up. What made us different is we didn’t stop at scoring.
